# Ultrasound Screen Capture
My code to capture portions of computer Screen for ultrasound image acquisition. Currently dimensions are set to my monitor.

There are two files - 
1. Screen_Capture.py - Initial implementation for simple screen grabbing for one frame.
2. Ultrasound_Video.py - Final implementation for screen grabbing for multiple frames and saving them.

This was utilized for **Tele-operative Robotic Lung Ultrasound Scanning Platform for Triage of COVID-19 Patients** project by Ryosuke Tsumura, John W. Hardin, me, Olushola S. Odusanya, Yihao Zheng, Jeffrey C. Hill, Beatrice Hoffmann, Winston Soboyejo, Haichong K. Zhang, a project in collaboration with WPI Robotics, WPI Mechanical Engineering, WPI biomedical engineering, Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA).
